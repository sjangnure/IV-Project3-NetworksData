# IV-Project3-NetworksData
CSGY 6313: Information Visualisation Mini Project 3. Visuals for Networks Data.
Visualisations using javascript D3 that answer the below questions for aid data. Data: https://www.aiddata.org/data/aiddata-core-research-release-level-1-3-1

Visualization 1: Create an overview of the relationships between countries so that it is possible to see who donates to whom and how much. The main question one should be able to answer is: who are the major donors and to which countries do they donate the most and how much? And conversely, who are the major receivers and which countries do they receive from the most and how much? We only care about the top 10 recipients and the top 20 donors over time for this question.

Visualization 2: Considering only the top 5 purposes of donation, how does the relationship between countries look like in terms of purposes? What composition of  purposes do the donations between each pair of countries have? Are there countries that donate to a given country using multiple purposes? Or do counties always donate using one single purpose when donating to another country? The same as the previous question, we only care about the top 10 recipients and the top 20 donors here.

Visualization 3: For this last exercise you have to extend the analysis above to see how the patterns of donations change over time. Focusing again on the top 10 recipients and top 20 donors how do the patterns of donations (who donates to whom and how much) change over time? Are there sudden changes? Are there countries that always donate to other countries? Are there major shifts?
